        <p>Hello world,</p>

<p>I am a young engineer from Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, passionate about technology and entrepreneurship. I have recently finished a Master of Management of Innovation at the University of Toronto, to better understand the business side of technology. </p>

<p>Among other experiences, I have worked as a financial analyst at Natixis and EY, and in business development at Xtreme Labs, a mobile development startup (acquired by Pivotal in 2013).  I am currently working as a consultant at Capgemini Consulting on challenges of digital transformation and Big Data.</p>

<p>Among my side projects, I have collaborated with exciting technology startups such as: </p>

<ul>
<li>My Major Company, the leading crowdfunding platform in France,</li>
<li>Solar Ship, a solar aircraft manufacturer planning to revolutionize transportation</li>
<li>My Studio Assistant, a web publishing service for artists, 
I am also the co-founder of Refresh, a crowdsourcing platform for students at Ecole des Ponts. </li>
</ul>

<p>I am always learning new things, from economics to coding. I enjoy mathematical models, algorithms and analyzing data. In my spare time, you can find me on the Internet, reading and blogging about technology and innovation.</p>
